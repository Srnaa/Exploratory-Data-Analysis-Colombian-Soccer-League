# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Colombian-Soccer-League

Data analysis is all about answering questions with data. This Exploratory data analysis focuses on showcasing the historical performance of the two main teams in Colombian soccer, Millonarios FC and Atl√©tico National.

Through this data analysis, I want to answer the following question: How have the win percentages for the 2 major Colombian soccer teams change over the last forty years? also graphically represent how these teams have performed in this period of time.
